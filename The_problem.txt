PCR duplicates

The problem with PCR duplicates occurs when multiple sequencing reads result from the same molecule of from the DNA library. This occurs because amplification during library prep creates many copies of each molecule. This becomes can become a problem for example, during RNA seq. PCR duplicates can skew the counts data in differential expression and make it seem like there is more of a certain transcript than there is in reality.

Two mechanisms can be used to combat this. The first is utilizing universal molecular identifiers. These are short sequences appended to the ends of the library fragments that act as barcodes. After sequencing these can be identified in the reads and reads with repeating UMIs can be thrown out. The problem with this is sequencing error can prevent the UMIs from being read perfectly. The other mechanism is to compare the chr, strandedness and alignment position from the SAM file. There are also complications in this method resulting from soft clipping. Soft clipping occurs when bases are not included in the alignment, but are still apart of the sequence in a SAM file. Soft clipping moves the alignment position and the alignment position needs to be corrected when soft clipping occurs. These two mechanisms can be combined to find PCR duplicates and remove them by Keeping track of UMI-alignment position pairs. If pair has already been seen before then that read is considered a duplicate and is thrown out.
