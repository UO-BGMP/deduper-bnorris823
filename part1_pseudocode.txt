Write argparse code to input filename/location as a variable.

Create two empty lists - 
	-One will contain the alignment positions.
	-The other will contain UMI/Randomers.

Open file:

	Iterate through the file line by line AKA read by read
	
	For each read:
		-Parse the cigar string and adjust the alignment position if soft clipping is present.

		-Once alignment is adjusted, check first list to see if position has been seen before.
			if not, add it to the list and return true, else return false

		-check to see if UMI/Randomer has been seen before.
			if not, add it to the list and return true, else return false
		
		-if both alignment and UMI functions return true, output read to new file, else go to next read.
