Write argparse code to input filename/location as a variable.

Create two empty lists - 
	-One will contain the alignment positions.
	-The other will contain UMI/Randomers.

Open file:

	Iterate through the file line by line AKA read by read
	
	For each read:
		-Parse the cigar string and adjust the alignment position if soft clipping is present.

		-Once alignment is adjusted, check first list to see if position has been seen before.
			if not, add it to the list and return true, else return false

		-check to see if UMI/Randomer has been seen before.
			if not, add it to the list and return true, else return false
		
		-if both alignment and UMI functions return true, output read to new file, else go to next read.

def cigar_parse(cigar_string, alignment_pos):
	if soft clipping present?
		correct alignment position
	else
		do nothing
	return corrected alignment position
	
def check_alignment(corrected alignment, alignment_list):
	look for corrected alignment in alignment list
	return True of False
	
def parse_UMI(seq):
	pull out UMI substring from the seq
	return UMI
	
def check_UMI(UMI, UMI_list):
	look for UIM in UMI_list
	return True or False
